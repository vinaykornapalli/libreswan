This tests the (oddly designed) EVENT_PENDING_DDNS

- load a connection with an unresolvable name
- once loaded, fix so the name resolves
- wait and a minute later the connection will initiate

Note, this now requires auto=start in the config file, as the previous
behaviour of wrongly initiating auto=add on ddns updates no longer
causes that
